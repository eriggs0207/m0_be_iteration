# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

Confident on how it works. Need more practice writing code using it and other methods combined

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

I had productive struggles in this exercise.  Anything issues I ran into I was able to use my resources to work through methodically

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

This particular lesson came easier than others.  I think I need to practice writing code with the each method.  I do not need to adjust my calendar to achieve this.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I still do not understand what word goes in the pipes inside the code block of the each method.  It was listed in the examples differently than the variable it was using.  I will ask in slack
